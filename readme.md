# 📦 Kiosk TypeScript App Template
 
Just a template with boilerplate to start a new Kiosk front-end app or library.
It does not contain the Python part for a plugin, so this is only the "app" part of a plugin. 
### how to use
- This needs an initial `npm link {path-to-kiosktsapplib library} --save`
- then the usual changes in the package.json, where all "kiosktsapptemplate" occurences have to be replaced with the actual project
- the app.ts is the starting point for development.
